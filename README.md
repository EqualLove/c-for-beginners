  If you're a beginner in the C language or want to practice there is some challanges for you to train your C!
</p>

## How to compile and run C code? ##
You can run C code using gcc.exe file. You can find it by downloading mingw (mingw32\bin\gcc.exe).

Using (I'm recommend to add mingw32\bin to your path for using it in this way):
```batch
  gcc your_c_code.c
```
